get a turn on earth and mars
most units should survive
Team has a common karbonite resource pool
Gain 10 karbonite per round -- goes down by 1 for every 40 karbonite; min amt is 0
Start with 100 karbonite; can be mined from earth or mars
map has arbitrary size but earth and mars have same size
if a square is passable a unit can occupy it 
Karbonite deposits exist on both planets and are passable
--deposits have limited amt of karbonite
ONLY workers can mine karbonite deposits

if bluprint or rocket is on karbonite deposit then all karbonite disappears

Earth:
passable deposits for Karbonite and impassable water depos
Karbonite is limited on earth and karbonite is NEVER added back
--first deposits is between x=[0,50]

earth flood round 750

Mars:
passable squares and deposits for Karbonite and impassable rocky outcrops
No karbonite @ first
Asteroids frequently hit with lots of karbonite
How often asteroids come is known

--first deposits is between x=[0,50]

earth flood round 750

Units:
types: robots and structures
robots fight, move, and collect resources
structures: rockets and factories
rockets go to mars
factories produce robots
unit gets int ID

To create structure worker must put down a blueprint
blueprints must be repeatedly put down until structure is created
buying blue-prints --> lower cost for them
Structures hv garrison which holds 8 robots

NO STRUCTURES ON MARS

Factories spawn robots and automatically store them in their garrison
Rockets and factories both load and unload 

Research is used to upgrade and stuff
Only 1 upgrade can be researched @ a time and upgrade takes set amt of rounds
Theres a queue for stuff to be researched
**research is in branches because each robot has a branch it can go down for upgrades

TEAM shared communication arrays of length 100 for each planet, but to get communication from other planet
it would be 50 rounds late
Player can sense all lives and location stuff on planet WITHIN that player's bots' sensing range
Player can also GLOBALLY know if square is on planet, square is passable, coors, research, and karbonite 
(smallest unit in this game is 1 turn)
--Robots have a movement cooldown as well as an attack cooldown, each of which correspond to an internal heat. 
--Robots can move only when their movement heat is less than 10, and they can only attack when their attack heat is less than 10. 
--Both heats decrement by 10 at the start of every round, to a minimum of 0. 
--When a robot moves, its movement heat is incremented by its movement cooldown, and likewise for when a robot attacks.

MapLocation object is for planets and Location is for robots
