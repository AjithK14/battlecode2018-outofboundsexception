get a turn on earth and mars
most units should survive
Team has a common karbonite resource pool
Gain 10 karbonite per round -- goes down by 1 for every 40 karbonite; min amt is 0
Start with 100 karbonite; can be mined from earth or mars
map has arbitrary size but earth and mars have same size
if a square is passable a unit can occupy it 
Karbonite deposits exist on both planets and are passable
--deposits have limited amt of karbonite
ONLY workers can mine karbonite deposits

if bluprint or rocket is on karbonite deposit then all karbonite disappears

Earth:
passable deposits for Karbonite and impassable water depos
Karbonite is limited on earth and karbonite is NEVER added back
--first deposits is between x=[0,50]

earth flood round 750

Mars:
passable squares and deposits for Karbonite and impassable rocky outcrops
No karbonite @ first
Asteroids frequently hit with lots of karbonite
How often asteroids come is known

--first deposits is between x=[0,50]

earth flood round 750

Units:
types: robots and structures
robots fight, move, and collect resources
structures: rockets and factories
rockets go to mars
factories produce robots
unit gets int ID

To create structure worker must put down a blueprint
